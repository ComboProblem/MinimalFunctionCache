# Minimal Function Cache

Minimal Funciotn Cache is a repository for a proposed cut generation method in the thesis of Acadia Larsen which uses an explicit method select optimal cuts over a space of valid intersection cuts for a given MIP relaxation basis. 

## Included Software, Tools, Documentation

- Experimental Cut and Branch Solver using explicitly optimized cuts over the space of minimal functions with a finite number of breakpoints. 

- Code for generating represenative elements of minimal functions for a semialgebraic parametric description of minimal functions in the Gomory Johnson Group Problem using high preformance computing cluster.

- A cache of computed repersenative elements.

- Reproducable computational experiments.
  
- Documentation: Customizable interfaces for the solver to various components.

- Documentation: Mathematical framework.  

# Goals and Non-Goals

## Goals
 - Illustrate concept of expicit optimal cut selection. 
 - Reproducablity on local and HPC machines.
 - Mathematical correcntness of cut generation.

## Non-goals

 - Preformance and code optimization; the cut generation technique presented is a proof of concept and is intended to function (for practical problem) with an excess of compute.
