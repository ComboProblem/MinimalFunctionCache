# Minimal Function Cache

Minimal Funciotn Cache is an repository for a proposed cut and branch paradime proposed in the thesis of Acadia Larsen which uses an explicit method select optimal cuts over a space of valid intersection cuts for a given MIP relaxation basis. 

## Included Software and Tools

- Experimental Cut and Branch Solver using explicitly optimized cuts over the space of minimal functions with a finite number of breakpoints. 

- Code for generating represenative elements of minimal functions for a semialgebraic parametric description of minimal functions in the Gomory Johnson Group Problem using high preformance computing cluster.

- A cache of computed repersenative elements.

- Reproducable computational experiments.
